## ## Roadmap : Email Integration , Key-Value Store on Server, Combine Features

### Part 1: Email Integration
- [x] Create an endpoint in your /api folder called email.js
- [x] The endpoint should return a JSON object with a message that says "Email sent!" or "Error sending email!"
- [x] Create an account on resend.com
- [x] Send an email to yourself using the API endpoint you just created
- [x] Explains the server architecture and includes the diagram in README.md

### Part 2: Key-Value Store on Server

- [x] - Use Upstash to add data persistence to your server
- [x] - Custom Components: on more-cats page 
- [x] - Component Reusability: components reused from cats part 2 & 3
- [x] Bonus: Successfully implemented at least one stretch goal, including creating and using custom components

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
